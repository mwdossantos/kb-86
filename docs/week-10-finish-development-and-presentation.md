# Week 10 - Finish Development & Presentation

## Finish Development & Presentation

Again, thank you for taking the time to read this week's update. As you can see in the following table, I have a couple of activities planned that I will do in order to get my desired result: Finish Development & Presentation.

## Activities

| What | Finalized |
| :--- | :---: |
| Refactoring the code | 🧑🏻‍💻 |
| Final run | 🧑🏻‍💻 |
| Presentation | 🧑🏻‍💻 |

### Refactoring the code

As with any coding project the end is a good place to start looking back at your code, and polish it where needed. A lot of times I notice that I have duplicate code, which I could have handled more efficiently. A couple of examples are:

### Final run

After I finished creating the application I had a few small things left to do. The application icon I designed in Week 7 was not yet implemented, so I added it:

Also, the display name of the app was the same as the project, namely "Star Wars Favorites". This was way to long and on the device it looked weird. That's why I changed the *product* name to "SW: Favorites". A lot better :)
