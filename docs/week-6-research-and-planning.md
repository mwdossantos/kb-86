### Learning goal and deliverable
Defining the learning goal and deliverable

I am going to dive deep into front-end coding with **Swift**, and especially **SwiftUI**, Apple's new framework for building UI's with code. 


And thus my learning goal shall be:

> Get the hang of Swift and the SwiftUI framework.

Looking back at the first part of this minor, everyone agreed that without clear deliverables set into place, it would become hard to see where we were all going. That's why I have a deliverable set, namely:

> An iOS/macOS app that works on both iPhone and iPad.

### Choosing a theme
> Choosing a theme for the deliverable

Thinking about several themes a few sprung to mind:

#### Audi

#### Star Wars

#### COVID-19

### Planning
Thinking out the next few weeks - planning. You can find this planning on the [README](https://github.com/mwdossantos/kb-86) page as well for the overall project.

### Data & problem
Decide which data to build the app around - what's the problem I'm trying to solve?

### Goals for the app:

* App to view characters
* View the timeline
* View movie plot information
* CMS with interconnected items
