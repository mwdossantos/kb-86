### Defining the Data

With these needs come a couple of requirements:

* A customizable content management system, as I want to be as efficient as possible.
* Mobile Media for each planet, to get an impression of the planet


Each planet shows in which movies they have appeared

II: Attack of the Clones

III: Revenge of the Sith

Solo: A Star Wars Story

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story

IV: A New Hope

V: The Empire Strikes Back

VII: The Force Awakens

VIII: The Last Jedi

IX: The Rise of Skywalker
