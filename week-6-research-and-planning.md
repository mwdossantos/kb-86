# Week 6: Research & Planning

I hereby welcome you to the next part of this minor. We are going to dive deep into front-end coding with **Swift**, and especially **SwiftUI**, Apple's new framework for building UI's with code. 

And thus my learning goal shall be:

> Get the hang of Swift and the SwiftUI framework.

Looking back at the first part of this minor, everyone agreed that without clear deliverables set into place, it would become hard to see where we were all going. That's why I have a deliverable set, namely:

> An iOS/macOS app that works on both iPhone and iPad.

Thinking about several themes a few sprung to mind:
