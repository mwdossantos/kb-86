      "description": "Although Ajan Kloss was a moon, it had two moons of its own. Its gas giant shielded it from harmful radiation. The jungle resonated with life and Resistance scouts would routinely check for new species to be used in medicine, though the moist environment meant technichians had to work double-time to moisture proof electronics. Other annoyances on the planet included fungal and insect infections, but there were no large predators on the planet. Jedi Master Luke Skywalker compared Ajan Kloss with the planet Dagobah, where he trained years before with Yoda. He noted that the similarities between Dagobah and Ajan Kloss were that they were wet, warm, green and overflowing with life, but the main difference was that Ajan Kloss didn't smell bad. The Ajara gas giant reflected sunlight onto the planet's surface, allowing plants to gain sustenance even at night.",

However, the scouts deliberately hid it from the Imperial Senate because it was short-listed as a potential home for a rebel base like Yavin 4 and Dantooine, but the shifting battlefront against the Empire precluded Ajan Kloss from being used during the conflict, yet it served as a training ground for Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa at the latter's suggestion sometime afterthe Battle of Endor."

They later returned with the allied fleet for the victory celebrations."

That year, the then-Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, Finis Valorum, was ousted from office, and Antilles was nominated for the position in the resulting election.

Through Organa, Alderaan was a member of Chancellor Palpatine's Loyalist Committee, which concerned itself with the stability of the Republic during the Separatist crisis and would later strive to limit Palpatine's increasing executive authority. That year, an army of clones was discovered on the planet Kamino, which would be appropriated by the Senate in order to combat the Separatists. To save the Republic from the impending threat, the Supreme Chancellor was granted emergency powers, a decision that was contrary to the pacifist values of Alderaan and its representative and which ultimately led to the outbreak of the Clone Wars.[27]"

Many of these individuals arrived on Lah'mu seeking to avoid war; among them were the Erso family, whose association with Orson Krennic during the Clone Wars forced them into hiding on the remote, inaccessible world. Galen and Lyra Erso chose to reside in a sixty-five hectare homestead on the planet's less popular eastern side, purchased with the assistance of Saw Gerrera. The Ersos grew crops and utilized Pretormin Environmental GX-8 water vaporators to distill water vapor from the air. Unfortunately for the family, Director Krennic ultimately tracked them down, and arrived on Lah'mu to take Galen, Lyra, and their young daughter Jyn, with him to ensure the completion of his stalled Death Star project. Galen refused, and a brief firefight erupted in which Krennic was dealt a glancing blow and Lyra was shot dead. Krennic's death troopers burned the homestead and took Galen into custody, while Jyn fled to the black gulch beyond the former homestead's edge. There, she secreted herself in a shelter beneath a hidden hatch camouflaged by an artificial rock. She was later rescued by Gerrera."
