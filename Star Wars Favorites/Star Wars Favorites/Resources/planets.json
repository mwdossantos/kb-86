      "description": "Although Ajan Kloss was a moon, it had two moons of its own. Its gas giant shielded it from harmful radiation. The jungle resonated with life and Resistance scouts would routinely check for new species to be used in medicine, though the moist environment meant technichians had to work double-time to moisture proof electronics. Other annoyances on the planet included fungal and insect infections, but there were no large predators on the planet. Jedi Master Luke Skywalker compared Ajan Kloss with the planet Dagobah, where he trained years before with Yoda. He noted that the similarities between Dagobah and Ajan Kloss were that they were wet, warm, green and overflowing with life, but the main difference was that Ajan Kloss didn't smell bad. The Ajara gas giant reflected sunlight onto the planet's surface, allowing plants to gain sustenance even at night.",

However, the scouts deliberately hid it from the Imperial Senate because it was short-listed as a potential home for a rebel base like Yavin 4 and Dantooine, but the shifting battlefront against the Empire precluded Ajan Kloss from being used during the conflict, yet it served as a training ground for Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa at the latter's suggestion sometime afterthe Battle of Endor."

Through Organa, Alderaan was a member of Chancellor Palpatine's Loyalist Committee, which concerned itself with the stability of the Republic during the Separatist crisis and would later strive to limit Palpatine's increasing executive authority. That year, an army of clones was discovered on the planet Kamino, which would be appropriated by the Senate in order to combat the Separatists. To save the Republic from the impending threat, the Supreme Chancellor was granted emergency powers, a decision that was contrary to the pacifist values of Alderaan and its representative and which ultimately led to the outbreak of the Clone Wars.[27]"

The mission became complicated after Krennic had Erso's fellow scientists shot in order to draw out a confession, and Rebel starfighters bombed the Eadu complex landing platform.

As a result of the repulsorlift field emitted by the SLD-26 planetary shield generator to keep the Death Star in a stationary orbit, Endor was prone to earthquakes, tidal imbalances, and other geological disturbances."

With the destruction of the Empire's dreaded battle station and the death of Galactic Emperor Palpatine and his enforcer, Darth Vader, the Rebels and Ewoks held a victory celebration on the moon, one of many across the galaxy."

It was also the birthplace of Supreme Leader Snoke, whom Sidious created to rule the First Order while concealing himself in the shadows. Exegol was used to hide the Sith Eternal fleet amassed by Sidious and the Sith Eternal, from where they planned to deploy the Sith fleet and establish a New Empire.

Exegol was one of the oldest Sith bastions, dating back to about a thousand years prior to the fall of the Galactic Republic. Under the Sith, the Sith Citadel was built on Exegol for meetings and rituals to be conducted within, and Sith loyalists excavated the world's large and deep planetary fissures in hopes of reaching a vergence believed to lie beneath the planet surface."

After Sidious' death at the Battle of Endor, the Sith Eternal cult chose Exegol as their base because it was completely hidden from even the most studious of galactic historians, some of whom knew about Korriban/Moraband and the other Sith worlds. The Sith loyalists then proceeded to construct a massive fleet of warships. This was comprised of hundreds of Xyston-class Star Destroyers, which were intended for the Sith's reconquest of the galaxy. As threats of their return to the wider galaxy loomed, the Resistance mustered its forces and made a desperate battle against the Sith. Ultimately, with the help of the galaxy fleet, the Resistance was able to destroy the Sith Star Destroyers and kill Emperor Darth Sidious."

Though considered by many within the galaxy to be distant and relatively worthless, Jakku was the site of important events that would shape galactic history. In 5 ABY, Jakku was the site of the pivotal Battle of Jakku, which ended the Galactic Civil War in favor of the New Republic. A generation later, the planet was the home of the scavengerRey, who became involved in the events of the cold war after helping the former First Order stormtrooper Finn and the astromech droid BB-8escape offworld with a map leading to the missing Jedi Luke Skywalker.",

Several New Republic figures including Admiral Ackbar, Commodore Kyrsta Agate, Captain Wedge Antilles, Temmin Wexley, and Jom Barellwould see action in the cataclysmic Battle of Jakku. The battle would take place one year and four days after the Battle of Endor. It became the last major stand of the Galactic Empire and last major battle of the Galactic Civil War. In secret, the Battle of Jakku served as a pretext for Rax to facilitate the final stage of the Contingency."

The First Order forces, led by Kylo Ren, attacked the village of Tuanul, where the mystic Lor San Tekka lived and kept the map to Skywalker. However, San Tekka was able to give the map to Poe Dameron, who in turn hid it in his droid, BB-8, before Dameron was captured.\nThe attack led to the defection of stormtrooper FN-2187, who aided Dameron's ecsape from the Finalizer in a stolen TIE/sf space superiority fighter. Ultimately, FN-2187 (\"Finn\") would escape the planet with an unknowingly Force-sensitive girl named Rey."

As well as the Jedi, the Disciples and Guardians of the Whills represented a dominant faith on Jedha. They, along with the Church of the Force, were centered at the Temple of the Kyber, a great temple located in the city of NiJedha. This spiritual history led to Jedha becoming an important location for pilgrims of various faiths, including those of the Brotherhood of the Beatific Countenance, the Clan of the Toribota, and the Central Isopter."

Initially hosting several moons, Lah'mu gained a planetary ring after one ancient satellite was pulverized, its remaining material pulled into orbit to form silica rings that cast shadows across the planet's surface. Volcanoes ejected tephra during this formative period, contaminating Lah'mu's natural greenery, forcing later settlers to carefully sift the soil."

Many of these individuals arrived on Lah'mu seeking to avoid war; among them were the Erso family, whose association with Orson Krennic during the Clone Wars forced them into hiding on the remote, inaccessible world. Galen and Lyra Erso chose to reside in a sixty-five hectare homestead on the planet's less popular eastern side, purchased with the assistance of Saw Gerrera. The Ersos grew crops and utilized Pretormin Environmental GX-8 water vaporators to distill water vapor from the air. Unfortunately for the family, Director Krennic ultimately tracked them down, and arrived on Lah'mu to take Galen, Lyra, and their young daughter Jyn, with him to ensure the completion of his stalled Death Star project. Galen refused, and a brief firefight erupted in which Krennic was dealt a glancing blow and Lyra was shot dead. Krennic's death troopers burned the homestead and took Galen into custody, while Jyn fled to the black gulch beyond the former homestead's edge. There, she secreted herself in a shelter beneath a hidden hatch camouflaged by an artificial rock. She was later rescued by Gerrera."

Unlike most other worlds, the ancient planet lacked a molten core, and instead comprised a conglomerate of large, rocky bodies that made up a network of tunnels and flooded caves. The native Gungans, who built their homes in the waters of Naboo, rarely ventured into the core, fearing the ravenous sea beasts which resided in areas such as the Caves of Eleuabad. Despite this, certain Gungan navigators utilized time-honored trade routes through the planet's structure, which served as the most expedient avenues to reach other areas of the planet.",

Eventually, the Elders vanished as mysteriously as they arrived, leaving only stone statues behind. For thousands of years afterward the Gungans flourished until a group of human colonists from Grizmallt crash-landed on Naboo. Initially, the Gungans retreated underwater and avoided the colonists. When the Gungans finally met the colonists, diplomacy failed and the two species fought a series of wars over territory and resources before largely resolving to live apart and ignore each other. A series of internal wars amongst the Gungan tribes and the human city-states eventually ended with both factions being unified in their own way but still separate nonetheless."

In an upsurge of sympathy and solidarity toward the invaded planet, the queen's emissary in the Galactic Senate, the seemingly unassuming Senator Sheev Palpatine, was made Supreme Chancellor of the Republic."

Their attempt was successful, and they managed to transmit the plans to Princess Leia Organa. However, Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin ordered the Death Star to fire a precise single reactor blast at the planet, not destroying Scarif itself but dissipating its planetary shield and obliterating the Citadel Tower as well as everyone in its vicinity in an unsuccessful effort to halt the transmission, as well as eliminate his longtime rival, Orson Krennic. The Death Star's superlaser boiled the oceans of Scarif, burning the surface of the planet."

It was the homeworld to the influential Anakin and Luke Skywalker, who would go on to shape galactic history. Part of a binary star system, the planet was oppressed by scorching suns, resulting in the world lacking the necessary surface water to sustain large populations. As a result, many residents of the planet instead drew water from the atmosphere via moisture farms. The planet also had no natural surface vegetation.",

Afterwards, she later traveled to the Lars moisture farm on Tatooine with BB-8, where she buried Leia's lightsaber and the Skywalker lightsaber, using her own newly-crafted one in their place. When a local asked for her name, she forwent Palpatine's lineage, going by the name \"Rey Skywalker\" with the blessing of the Force spirits of Luke and Leia. Rey and BB-8 then looked off into the distance as the twin suns of Tatooine set."

I'd met Jabba. Jabba had never bathed in his life.\""
